# pokemon-map-gen
A simple 2d map gen using sprite mapping with D3.js

This was for a university class named Creative Coding, which focused on data visualization, DOM manipulation, and front-end development. The goal was to use a user input to manipulate an object on the DOM. We were asked to create a simple game. Think I missed the "simple" part.

The project contains all files needed to run the site locally. The demo can also be found [here](https://www.calumboone.com/projects/?p=0000).
